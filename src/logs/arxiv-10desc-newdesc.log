Here's a rough estimate of the cost; it might not be accurate and we are not responsible for any cost incurred.
Each round costs 0.00, proposer spending 0.00, assigner spending 0.00. The final assignment costs 0.00.
Total cost is 0.02

In this task you will need to come up with categories to group the text together based on a goal, where each category can be described with a natural language predicate. For example

0. How are you doing?
1. How do I apply for visa?
2. Isn't it ridiculous?
3. How to get there by bus?
4. How is it going?
5. Aren't technological advancement good for the humanity?

Here is our goal: I want to cluster the questions based on their functionalities. Your responses are:
- "is a rhetorical quesiton"
- "is meant for greetings"
- "is asking for practically useful information"

(note that all of them need to be natural language predicates that can be validated on the given samples)

Here is our goal: I would like to cluster them based on topic; each cluster should have a description of 'has a topic of <something>' 
Please suggest me a few descriptions, one in a line, starting with "-" and surrounded by quotes"". In terms of formatting, each of them needs to be a predicate about a text, for example:
- "uses double negation"
- "has a conservative stance"

Do not output anything else. (Note that the examples might not be goal related, and your response should be both formatted correct as above and related to the goal.)
Here are some example predicates; the generated predicates should have a similar granularity and perspective:

"has a topic of evolutionary algorithms"
"has a topic of computational intelligence"


Again, here's the goal: I would like to cluster them based on topic; each cluster should have a description of 'has a topic of <something>'. Your responses are:
